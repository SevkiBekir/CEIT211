CEIT211 LAB HOMEWORK LAB 81. In the following program, use a class Money to add two dollar amounts.  The class is defined with a member function add that adds the dollars and cents amounts for the two inputs.  Complete the following program. (1$=100 cents)#include<iostream>#include<cstdlib>using namespace std;class Money{    public:        Money();        Money(int d, int c);        void add(Money m1, Money m2);        void display_money( );    private:        int dollars;        int cents;};void read_money(int& d, int& c);int main( ){     int d, c;     Money m1, m2, sum;     sum = Money(0,0);     read_money(d, c);     m1 = Money(d,c);     cout << "The first money is:";     //call display_money() to display content of m1     read_money(d, c);     m2 = Money(d,c);     cout << "The second money is:";      //call display_money() to display content of m2     sum.add(m1,m2);     cout << "The sum is:";     sum.display_money();     return 0;}Money::Money(){}//constructor to initialize data members to the parameters it receives//add member function to add two Money objects and store the result in the resultant objvoid Money::display_money(){    //display the data members}// read_money() function to input dolar and cent values and returning them as reference parameters2. Modify the above program to write add as a friend function.3. Modify the above program to include the following changes.            1) make function add of type Money.  Thus, this function now computes the sum of dollars and cents and returns it as Money object.              2) add a new friend function, subtract, that computes the subtraction of one money from the other.            3) Make read_money a member function.  Note that if you make read_money a member function, then you can use it to directly initialize the dollars and cents of an Money type object directly.4. In Money class, instead of add() member function, overload the "+" operator as a friend function so that is does what the function add is doing.5. In Money class overload > operator as a member function, so that it compares two Money objects and returns the bigger one.6. In Money class overload >> to read an object of type Money.
